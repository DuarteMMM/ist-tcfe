\section{Simulation Analysis} \label{sec:simulation}

The simulation utilized a given op-amp in order to simulate the circuit in Figure 1. 



The input and output impedances of the system as a whole were determined. The output impedance was simulated with $V_{in}$ turned off and a voltage source with amplitude of 1V in the output. The results obtained are shown in Table \ref{tab:impe}, together with the theoretical analysis'.

As it was intended, the input impedance is high and the output impedance is really small.

Now, the plots of the output signal and the gain are presented. For a transient analysis of frequency f=1kHz for the the output has been plotted in Figure \ref{fig:out1}. We can notice that there are no observable losses from the original signal, that is, the wave is still sinusoidal. The plot was made ate a later time (not t=0) when there are no transient variances in the signal.

\end{figure}

Regarding the plot of the gain, we can see that the passband effect is achieved being that the gain is only maximum for an intermediate level of frequencys.

Finally, the total monetary cost and the merit $M$ of the circuit have been calculated and are shown below in Table \ref{tab:rip1}. These were determined by using the results obtained from Ngspice. The cost is given by $cost=cost\; of\; resistors\; +\; cost\; of\; capacitor\; +\; cost\; of\; transistores$, in which each 1$k\Omega$ in the resistances costs 1 monetary unit (MU), as well as each 1$\mu F$ in the capacitance; the cost of each transistor is 0.1 MU. On the other hand, the merit M is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eq:merit}
  M=\frac{1}{cost\times GainDeviation \times CentralFrequencydeviation} 
\end{equation}
