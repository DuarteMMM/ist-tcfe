\section{Simulation Analysis} \label{sec:simulation}

In order to simulate this circuit with Ngspice, the ideal transformer model was used. Because the voltage in the primary, $v_{T1}$, is known, the primary was replaced by a dependant current source and the secondary by a dependant voltage source, in order to have a voltage $v_{T2}=\frac{v_{T2}}{n}$ in the secondary. The values used for $R_1$, $R_2$, $C$, $V_{T2}$ and $n$ are those shown in Table \ref{tab:ChosenValues} of Section \ref{sec:analysis}.
