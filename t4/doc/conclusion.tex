\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the intended objective has been achieved. The Audio Amplifier circuit has been simulated accordingly by using Ngspice and a rather good output signal and a high gain have been obtained. Moreover, a suitable theoretical model was utilized in order to compare the different values obtained from the simulation, having achieved quite similar results. However, the values obtained in the theoretical analysis for the output impedance and the lower cutoff frequency were rather far away from the respective simulation values. The differences between the results obtained in both analysis may be due to several factors. The theoretical transistor model considered is different from the much more complex transistor model used by Ngspice. Moreover, the theoretical analysis is subjected to many approximations.

A gain close to 36 was obtained for both cases. A bigger value could have been obtained by using different values for the resistances and capacitances, for example. However, that would also lead to a larger monetary cost. By taking into account the different aspects at hand, rather precise results and an acceptable merit M have been obtained.
