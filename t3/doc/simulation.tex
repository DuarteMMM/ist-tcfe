\section{Simulation Analysis}

Simulating the ciruit indicated we have obtained the following graphic that contemplates the voltage after the envelope circuit (out1) and the voltage that actually leaves the system, supposedly 12 V.

  \caption{Voltage after envelope circuit(out1) and after voltage ripple circuit (out2)}
  \label{fig:out1_out2}
\end{figure}


In the next graph we tried observing the fluctuations of the output around 0 for that we plotted the output voltage obtained at any instant subtracted by the desired voltage 12 V.
