% state the learning objective
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to use an AC/DC converter to obtain an output DC signal of value $12$ V from an input AC signal of amplitude $230$ V and frequency $50$ Hz. The envelope detector and voltage regulator circuits were chosen as shown in Figure \ref{fig:CircuitDraw}, in which designations have been assigned to each node.
\par
The envelope detector is formed by a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit, with 4 diodes connected to the resistor $R_1$, in parallel with the capacitor. On the other hand, the voltage regulator corresponds to the resistance $R_2$ in series with a positive voltage limiter (17 diodes in series). The values of the resistances and the capacitance and the number of diodes were chosen in order to decrease the monetary cost of the circuit and approximate the output signal to a constant $12$ V as much as possible.
