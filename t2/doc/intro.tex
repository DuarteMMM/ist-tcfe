% state the learning objective
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to analyse the RC circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:CircuitDraw}. As shown below, the nodes have been numbered, current names and directions have been assigned to all branches and potential $0V$ has been assigned to one of the nodes. By running the Python script \texttt{t2\_datagen.py}, the values shown in Table \ref{tab:GivenValues} have been obtained.
\par
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit and the results obtained with the Octave math tool are presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the results obtained using the Ngspice simulation tool are shown. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}, in which the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis} are compared to those presented in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}.
