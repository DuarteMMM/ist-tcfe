\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing the given circuit has been achieved. Static analysis has been performed both theoretically, using the Octave maths tool, and by circuit simulation, using the Ngspice tool. It is possible to verify that the simulation results matched the theoretical results precisely. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical and simulation models shall not differ. Only algebraic equations are involved.
\par
For more complex components, like transistors, it should be expected that the theoretical and simulation models could differ, but this is not the case in this lab assignment.
